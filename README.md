# Path Planning: ACO + PSO

A basic implementation of a hybrid path planning algorithm using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Using [Bevy](https://bevy.org/)

## How to Run

Need Rust installed: [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

```bash
cargo run

```

## Note
Everything about the algorithm should all be inside ```src/algorithm```, everything else just wrap around and use for render.
